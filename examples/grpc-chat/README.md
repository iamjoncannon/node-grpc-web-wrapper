# grpc-web chat

this is a React app with an express server using the grpcWebWrapper

demonstrates some relatively complex realtime features that can be supported with server streaming (sse, health checking, reconnection). see especially src/hooks

see package.json scripts for examples of how to compile protobufs for typescript grpc-web clients as well as typescript node services
